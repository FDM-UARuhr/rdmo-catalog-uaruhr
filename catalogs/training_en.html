Of course, the potential for subsequent use can not be the sole decision criterion, but legal impediments, such as Privacy, copyright and business secrets must be taken into account.

Otherwise, consider the re-use potential against the disadvantages, e.g. a decrease in the readiness to participate and the expected extra effort of a data publication.</td>

Other data cannot be collected or created anew.</td>
