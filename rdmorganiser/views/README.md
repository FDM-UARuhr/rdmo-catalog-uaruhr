# ERC view
This view is to be used with the 'UA Ruhr-Proposal' catalog.

## Development

The structure of the view is based on the official [ERC Data Management Template](ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/gm/reporting/h2020-erc-tpl-oa-data-mgt-plan_en.docx) (Version 1.0, 2017). Since this template is based on the [Horizon 2020 FAIR Data Management Plan template](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf) (Version 3.0, 2016), the contents of the existing H2020 view could be largely incorporated into the new ERC view. Therefore, a content mapping between the ERC template and the H2020 template was made by marking similar elements [here](https://github.com/ClaraRosalie/rdmo-catalog-uaruhr/tree/ERC-view/rdmorganiser/views) (erc_template.docx, h2020_template.docx).
