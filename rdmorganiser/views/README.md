# ERC view

## Development

The structure of the view is based on the official [ERC Data Management Template](ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/gm/reporting/h2020-erc-tpl-oa-data-mgt-plan_en.docx) (Version 1.0, 2017). Because this template references the [Horizon 2020 FAIR Data Management Plan template](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-data-mgt_en.pdf) (Version 3.0, 2016), the contents of the already existing H2020 view could be largely transferred to the new ERC view. Therefor a mapping of contents between the ERC template and the H2020 template has been made by marking similar aspects [here](https://github.com/ClaraRosalie/rdmo-catalog-uaruhr/tree/ERC-view/rdmorganiser/views) (erc_template.docx, h2020_template.docx).

## Current state

The ERC view has been developed in [rdmo-demo](https://rdmo-demo.rd.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/views/) and is saved as an [xml-file](https://github.com/ClaraRosalie/rdmo-catalog-uaruhr/blob/ERC-view/rdmorganiser/views/erc.xml). Additionally the UA Ruhr-Proposal catalog has been [updated](https://github.com/ClaraRosalie/rdmo-catalog-uaruhr/blob/ERC-view/tools/cat_member.yaml) so it fully covers the ERC view.
